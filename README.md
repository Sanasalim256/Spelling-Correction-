Spelling Correction is a very important task in Natural Language Processing. It is used in various tasks like search engines, sentiment analysis, text summarization, etc. As the name suggests, we try to detect and correct spelling errors in spelling correction.

Image-to-text conversion, also known as Optical Character Recognition (OCR), is the process of extracting textual content from images. This technology bridges the gap between visual and digital information, allowing computers to "read" and process text found in photographs, scanned documents, and other image formats.
Text extraction tools use machine algorithms to recognize and structure text from image files. The tools identify the shapes of letters on the image and reconstruct it as text you can select, copy-paste, and even edit.
